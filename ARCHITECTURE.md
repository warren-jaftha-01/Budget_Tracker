# 🏗️ Architecture Overview

## 📄 File: Architecture.md

### 📌 Description
This document outlines the **architectural structure** of the 🏦 Minimalist Budget Tracker. It provides a clear visualization of how the system is organized and how its components interact with each other. The architecture follows the **C4 Model**, which includes different levels of system abstraction to improve clarity and maintainability.

### 📊 What Will Be Covered
**🌍 Context Diagram** – Shows how the Budget Tracker interacts with users and external systems.

    Person(user, "User", "An individual who manages their budget manually.")
    System(budgetTracker, "Minimalist Budget Tracker", "A simple, web-based tool for manual finance tracking.")
    
    System_Ext(emailService, "Email Notification Service", "Sends budget summaries to users.")
    
    Rel(user, budgetTracker, "Uses to log income, expenses, and track balance manually")
    Rel(budgetTracker, emailService, "Sends budget-related email notifications")
  }
  
**📦 Container Diagram** – Breaks down the system into frontend, backend, and database components.

  Container_Boundary(systemBoundary, "Minimalist Budget Tracker") {
    Container(webApp, "Web Application", "React", "Allows users to log and track finances")
    ContainerDb(database, "Database", "MySQL", "Stores user and transaction data")
    Container(notificationService, "Notification Service", "Node.js", "Processes and sends email notifications")
  }

  System_Ext(extEmailService, "Email Service", "SMTP", "External service for sending emails")
  
  Rel(user, webApp, "Logs transactions")
  Rel(webApp, database, "Reads/Writes user data and transactions")
  Rel(webApp, notificationService, "Triggers email notifications")
  Rel(notificationService, extEmailService, "Sends emails via")

**🧩 Component Diagram** – Explores the internal structure of key application modules.

  Container(webApp, "Web Application", "React", "Allows users to log and track finances")

  Component(interface, "User Interface", "React Components", "Presents data and interacts with users")
  Component(transactionsHandler, "Transactions Handler", "JavaScript", "Processes transaction entry and updates")
  Component(apiClient, "API Client", "Axios", "Handles communication with services")

  ContainerDb(database, "Database", "MySQL", "Stores user and transaction data")

  Rel(interface, transactionsHandler, "Submits transaction data")
  Rel(transactionsHandler, apiClient, "Sends API requests")
  Rel(apiClient, database, "Fetches and updates data")

**🖥️ Deployment Diagram** – Represents how the system is deployed across different environments and devices.

  Deployment_Node(laptop, "User's Laptop", "Any") {
      Container(webApp, "Web Application", "React SPA", "Allows users to interact with the system")
  }
  
  Deployment_Node(server, "Cloud Server", "AWS EC2/ Firebase") {
    Container(database, "Database", "MySQL", "Stores user and transaction data")
    Container(notificationService, "Notification Service", "Node.js", "Handles email notifications")
  }

  System_Ext(emailService, "Email Service", "SMTP", "External SMTP service to send email")

  Rel(webApp, notificationService, "Sends notification requests")
  Rel(notificationService, emailService, "Sends emails via")
  Rel(webApp, database, "Sends/receives data from")

  
Each of these diagrams provides a different perspective, ensuring that developers, architects, and stakeholders can understand the system’s **design, interactions, and dependencies** at various levels. 

This document serves as a **📖 reference** for development, troubleshooting, and future system enhancements.
