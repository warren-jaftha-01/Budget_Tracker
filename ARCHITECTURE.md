# 🏗️ Architecture Overview

## 📄 File: Architecture.md

### 📌 Description
This document outlines the **architectural structure** of the 🏦 Minimalist Budget Tracker. It provides a clear visualization of how the system is organized and how its components interact with each other. The architecture follows the **C4 Model**, which includes different levels of system abstraction to improve clarity and maintainability.

### 📊 What Will Be Covered
1. **🌍 Context Diagram** – Shows how the Budget Tracker interacts with users and external systems.
2. **📦 Container Diagram** – Breaks down the system into frontend, backend, and database components.
3. **🧩 Component Diagram** – Explores the internal structure of key application modules.
4. **🔄 Dynamic Diagram** – Illustrates the workflow of critical system processes, such as adding transactions.
5. **🖥️ Deployment Diagram** – Represents how the system is deployed across different environments and devices.

Each of these diagrams provides a different perspective, ensuring that developers, architects, and stakeholders can understand the system’s **design, interactions, and dependencies** at various levels. 

This document serves as a **📖 reference** for development, troubleshooting, and future system enhancements.
